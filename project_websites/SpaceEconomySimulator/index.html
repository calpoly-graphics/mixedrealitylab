    <h3>How to Play</h3>

      an interplanetary corporation, headquartered on space station , aiming to score as much profit as possible while maintaining
      the station. Player actions include buying and selling goods from a trade route between planets, upgrading the space
      station, traveling to different trade routes, and deciding response to key events. The game ends when the player runs
