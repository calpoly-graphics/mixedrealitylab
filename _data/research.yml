- name: "Real-Time Ray Tracing with Spherically Projected Object Data"
  conf: "Published at ISVC 2019"
  tag: "As raytracing becomes feasible in regards to computational costs for real-time applications, new challenges emerge to achieve suffi- cient quality. To aim for an acceptable framerate, the amount of con- secutive rays is strongly reduced to keep the workload on the GPU low, but sophisticated approaches for denoising are required. One of the ma- jor bottlenecks is finding the ray intersection with the geometry. In this work, we present a fast alternative by pre-computing a spherical projection of an object and reduce the cost of intersection-testing independent of the vertex count by projecting the object onto a circumscribed sphere."

  tag: "The purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding on the role of immersive learning in regards to one’s intuition on the order of magnitude and scale, by using projectile motion as an example of Newton mechanics. We developed a semi-tangible virtual reality (VR) application that serves as virtual learning environment (VLE). In this ap- plication, participants throw objects and explore the effects of different conditions, such as variations in gravity and air density."

  tag: "The goal of this thesis is to digitally remove a real object from a real environment, causing the user to perceive that it doesn’t exist. This is useful when refurnishing a room and viewing virtual furniture to determine what furnishings to buy. Rather than physically removing existing furniture, we can digitally remove them before placing virtual content. This is all performed on the Microsoft HoloLens."

  tag: "Global illumination is a generic term that describes light that comes from indirect sources in a scene, such as from reflections and light scattering. In order to approximate this behavior in real-time, we use a filtered representation of a scene's radiance (light energy) and a cone tracing algorithm (similar to raymarching). The goal of this thesis is to improve upon this idea through various optimizations and to provide a public, easy-to-follow implementation for others to learn from or integrate into their own project."

Our goal is to find ways to improve existing rasterized renderers using this new approach to the long-standing problem of real-time ray tracing and evaluate its effectiveness. We are also working on ways to improve the performance of real-time ray tracing using DXR.  Finally, this work will also result in a good, publically available base library for DXR and DX12 for others to build on top of within and outside of the Mixed Reality Lab."
