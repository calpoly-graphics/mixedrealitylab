- name: "Advanced Real-Time Ray Tracing"
  tag: "This thesis is focused on leveraging existing rasterization techniques for quickly creating scenes while leveraging cutting-edge real-time ray tracing technologies using Microsoft's DXR API in DirectX 12. Our goal is to find ways to improve existing rasterized renderers using this new approach to the long-standing problem of real-time ray tracing and evaluate its effectiveness. We are also working on ways to improve the performance of real-time ray tracing using DXR.  Finally, this work will also result in a good, publically available base library for DXR and DX12 for others to build on top of within and outside of the Mixed Reality Lab."
